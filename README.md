# Creating a Toast Notification with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description

This simple project demonstrates how to create a toast notification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Toast notifications are a non-intrusive way to display messages or alerts to users, commonly seen in web applications to provide feedback or information. In this example, we have created a customizable toast notification system with different styles for success, error, and invalid messages.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Easily customize the toast message and appearance by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- **Different Styles**: Three different styles for success, error, and invalid messages, each with its own color and animation.
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Toast messages are automatically dismissed after 3 seconds.

Feel free to modify and adapt this toast notification system to suit your specific project requirements. Enjoy using this simple and effective way to communicate messages to your users!
